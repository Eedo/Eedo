## Inviting

If you haven't already, you can invite the bot through the dashboard, on a server Eedo is already in, or by clicking [here.](https://invite.eedo.app/).

Theres no need to configure permissions, as all the permissions selected are what the bot needs! **If you deselect permissions, you may be losing functionality with Eedo**, so talk with us on the support server if you have any questions about the permissions Eedo uses!

## Starting

Congratulations on inviting Eedo, your newest addition to your community! To start off, run the `/help` command to get a quick-start message that includes a link to our website and a support link to our support server. You can run `/settings` to configure the bot to how you wish. The bot comes ready out-of-the-box for simple use, so you don't need to configure anything to get started!

Setup is easy to do! Configure the bot to how you want it to work for your community. If you need help, you can always run `/help` to bring up the quick-start message.

If the bot does not respond to a command, you can always double check if the bot is online by using `/ping`. If the bot is online and is still not responding to commands, it might not have the correct permissions. To fix this, you can re-invite the bot to restore its original permissions.
