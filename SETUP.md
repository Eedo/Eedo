## Inviting

If you haven't already, you can invite the bot through the dashboard, on a server Exodus is already in, or by clicking [here.](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=449706234363510794&permissions=470281463&scope=bot).

## Starting

Congratulations on inviting Exodus! We are proud to serve you and your community. To start off, you can run `!settings` to get the list of modules you wish to enable. All of the modules that do not need configuring upon invite have already been enabled, so no need for immediate setup for those!

Setup is extremely user-oriented, so you'll have ease-of-use while configuring the bot. If you need help, you can always run `!help` to bring up the easy-start message.

If the bot does not respond on a command, you can always double check by using `!ping` or by pinging Exodus. If neither of those occur, please check that Exodus is online. If not, there is a possibility that you denied it key permissions. To fix this, simply add the `Administrator` permission to it. This will solve all future permission issues with the bot. Exodus **does NOT** abuse this permission, so no need to worry.
